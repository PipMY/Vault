## 1. Priority Queues

These are collections of prioritized elements that allows arbitrary element insertion and removal having the first priority (highest or lowest). It's just basically a queue but each element we put in has some kind of priority associated with it, and has the following operations:

- $P.add(k, v)$: Inserts an item with key $k$ and value $v$ into priority queue $P$.
- $P.min()$: Returns a tuple, $(k,v)$, representing the key and value of an item in priority queue $P$ with minimum key; an error occurs if the priority queue is empty
- $P.remove.min()$: Remove an item with minimum key from priority queue $P$, and returns a tuple, $(k,v)$, representing the key and value of the removed item; an error occurs if the priority queue is empty
- $P.is.empty()$: Returns true if priority queue $P$ does not contain any items.
- len(P): Return the number of items in priority queue $P$.

### Example


| Operation      | Return Value | Priority Queue              |
| -------------- | ------------ | --------------------------- |
| P.add(5,A)     |              | {(5,A)}                     |
| P.add(9,C)     |              | {(5,A), (9,C)}              |
| P.add(3,B)     |              | {(3,B), (5,A), (9,C)}       |
| P.add(7,D)     |              | {(3,B), (5,A), (7,D) (9,C)} |
| P.min()        | (3,B)        | {(3,B), (5,A), (7,D) (9,C)} |
| P.remove.min() | (3,B)        | {(5,A), (7,D) (9,C)}        |
| P.remove.min() | (5,A)        | {(7,D) (9,C)}               |
| len(P)         | 2            | {(7,D) (9,C)}               |
| P.remove.min() | (7,D)        | {(9,C)}                     |
| P.remove.min() | (9,C)        | { }                         |
| P.is.empty()   | True         | { }                         |
| P.remove.min() | < error >    | { }                         |

## 2. Heaps

BSTs and family are "proper" tree structures this means that each node has 0 or 2 children. Heaps are trees as well, but typically assumed to be stored in a flat array, they are physically in a linear array but logically are a binary tree, filled on all levels except the lowest.

Each tree node corresponds to an element of the array with the property that the tree is complete except perhaps the lowest level, filled left-to-right.

The diagram above might help this property become much more intuitive (it did for me atleast). 

### Max-Heap

For every node excluding the root:
- Value is at most that of its parent
- Largest element is stored at the root
- In any subtree, no values are larger than the value stored at subtree root

### Min-Heap

For every node excluding the root:
- Value is at least that of its parent
- Smallest element is stored at the root
- In any subtree, no values are smaller than the value stored at subtree root

A heap represented as an array $A$ has two attributes:

- Length(A) - number of elements in array $A$
- HeapSize(A) - number of elements in heap stored in $A$

Clearly, we need the $Length(A) \geq HeapSize(A)$ at all times. The height of a heap = $\lfloor  \log n\rfloor$. 

---

## 3. Heap Manipulation

### Insertion

To insert an element into a binary max-heap $H$:

1. Add the new element node to the bottom left of $H$.
2. If the new node value is bigger than its parent, swap their values. Set the parent node as the new node, go to step 2.
3. Else exit

Step $2$ in this process is called heapify. Which we will talk more about later. But what does this mean for array indices because in the real world that's what this theoretical data structures is implemented using. Assume we start counting at position 1 for any node located at index $i$:

- The root is in $A[1]$
- Parent-child relationships for index $i$
- $Left(i)=A[2i+1]$
- $Right(i) = A[2i+1]$
- $Parent(i)=A[i/2]$ (integer division)

### Extraction

In order to extract the maximum value from a max-heap we can use the following code:

$ret = A[1]$
$A[1] = A[HeapSize(A)]$
$HeapSize(A)=HeapSize(A)-1$
$Heapify(A,1,HeapSize(A))$
$return ret $

The time complexity for this is $O(\log n)$ because it's all $O(1)$ except heapify which is $O(\log n)$.

## 4. Heapify

Let's say due to some operations we get this resulting tree:

![[Pasted image 20250513011522.png]]

How would we turn this into a proper heap. (Notice that 5 is the root, so it is neither a max or min heap)

The idea is to do something called heapify which is as follows:

1. Starting at the root, identify largest of current node $v$ and its children
2. Suppose largest element is in $w$ 
3. if $w \ne v$ (basically if largest element is not the root we're looking at)
	1. Swap $A[w]$ and $A[v]$
	2. Recurse into $w$ (contains now what root contained properly)

### Algorithm

$Heapify(A, v, n)$:
	// n is heap size
	// find largest among v and 2v (left child)
	$largest = v$
	if $2v \le n$ and $A[2v] > A[v]$ then $largest = 2v$
	// find largest among winner above and 2v+1 (right child)
	if $2v+1 \le n$ and $A[2v+1] > A[largest]$ then $largest = 2v+1$
	if $largest \ne v$ then
	    swap $A[v], A[largest]$
	    $Heapify(A, largest, n)$

---

## 5. BuildHeap

We have another problem on our hands, what if we have a given array $A$ with $n$ arbitrary numbers stored in it and we want to convert $A$ into a heap. For example, the array $A=[6,1,10,8,3,7,2,4,9]$ gives the heap:

![[Pasted image 20250513012831.png]]

### Algorithm

$BuildHeap(A,n)$:
	for $i=n$ down to $1$ do
		$Heapify(A,i,n)$
	end for

The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n)$.

Heapify is also used to insert elements into heaps.

### Extraction

An element is always deleted from the root of the heap. So, deleting an element from the heap is done like so:

1. Replace the root node's value with the last node's value.
2. Delete the last node.
3. Move down the new root node's value so that it satisfies the heap property. In this step, interchange the root node's value with its child node's value.

---

## 6. HeapSort

This algorithm is used to sort an array of unsorted elements, what we do is build a max/min-heap (depending on if we want an ascending or descending sort), then follows these steps:

1. Swap the root with the last element
2. Reduce the heap size by one
3. Heapify the root again
4. Repeat steps 2-4 until the heap size is 1

### Algorithm

$HeapSort(A)$:
	$BuildHeap(A, Length(A))$
	for $i = Length(A)$ down to $2$ do
		swap $A[i]$ and $A[1]$
		$HeapSize(A) = HeapSize(A)-1$
		$Heapify(A, 1, HeapSize(A))$
	end for

The time complexity of this is $O(n\log n)$ in worst, average and best case scenario. Also just a reminder that heapify literally just makes something a heap so imagine that it lets the correct element bubble up or down depending on what's needed.
