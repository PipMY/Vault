## 1. Trees

A tree is a bit like a graph and we can have many different types of them, they connect nodes to other nodes by edges. Firstly we will look at the (Rooted) Binary tree.

### Binary Tree

This is a tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element can only have 2 children we typically name them the left and right child, and all rooted means in this type of binary tree is that it starts with 1 node known as the root note. All other nodes in the tree are descendants of the root.

An example (rooted) binary tree:
```
        A  ← root
       / \
      B   C
     / \
    D   E
```

### Definition 

A (rooted) binary tree is a finite set of nodes which are either empty or consists of a root and two disjoint binary trees (a left and right subtree).
- One entry point - The root
- Every node has at most two children
- Each child node is labeled as being either left child or right child
- Child-less nodes are called "leaves"

### Properties

- Every node (excluding the root) is connected by a directed edge from exactly one other node.
- Edge - The link from one node to another.
- Siblings - Two nodes that have the same parent.
- Path Length - The number of edges that must be traversed to get from one node to another.
- The size of a binary tree is the number of nodes in it.
- The depth of a node is its distance from the root.
- The depth of a binary tree is the depth of its deepest node.

Example of binary tree of depth 2:

```
        A  ← depth = 0
       / \
      B   C ← depth = 1
     / \
    D   E ← depth = 2
```

There is a lemma associated with this that is as follows:

Let $T$ be a rooted binary tree of height $h$. Then
- $T$ has at most $2^{h+1}-1$ nodes.
- $T$ has at most $2^h$ leaves.

## 2. Binary Search Tree (BST)


A BST is a binary tree where each node follows a key rule: 
For any node with value $x$:
- All values in the left subtree are $<x$.
- All values in the right subtree are $>x$.

This property can allow the tree to be traversed much more efficiently in hopefully just $O(\log n)$ time. And we'll look at three different methods of traversing.

### Pre-Order Traversal

Node -> Left -> Right

#### Example

```
          A
        /   \
       B     C
      / \   / \
     D   E F   G
```

ABDECFG would be the pre-order traversal of this depth 3 binary tree.

### In-order Traversal

Left -> Node -> Right

#### Example

```
          A
        /   \
       B     C
      / \   / \
     D   E F   G
```

DBEAFCG would be the in-order traversal of this depth 3 binary tree.

### Post-order Traversal

Left -> Right -> Node

#### Example

```
          A
        /   \
       B     C
      / \   / \
     D   E F   G
```

DEBFGCA would be the in-order traversal of this depth 3 binary tree.

### Sorting

For BSTs, the in-order traversal gives the elements in sorted order.

## 3. Operations on BSTs

There are many operations we can perform on a BST similar with most data structures; 
- Insertion
- Searching
- Deletion
- Traversing

In order to do each of these we will need some code, but first we need a class for a Node of a BST:

### Code - Class for BSTs

class Node:
	def _init_(self, data):
		self.left = None
		self.right = None
		self.data = None

We could then create a binary tree of depth 1 binary tree by calling $root=Node(x)$, where $x$ would then be at the root of the binary tree. This code will be assumed to be present by using the letter $\Phi$ in all later code.

### Code - Inserting into a BST

class Node:
	$\Phi$
	def insert(self, data):
		if data < self.data:
			if self.left is None:
				self.left = Node(data)
			else:
				self.left.insert(data)
		else:
			if self.right is None:
				self.right = Node(data)
			else:
				self.right.insert(data)

We could then insert an element into the BST using: $root.insert(x)$.

### Code - Searching in a BST

class Node:
	$\Phi$
	def lookup(self, data, parent=None):
		if data < self.data:
			if self.left is None:
				return None, None
			return self.left.lookup(data, self)
		elif data > self.data:
			if self.right is None:
				return None, None
			return self.right.lookup(data, self)
		else:
			return self, parent

This algorithm works by being called on the root of the tree, if its a match then return it, if its not then we go left or right depending on if the value is greater or less than the root, until it is found.


### Code - Deleting from a BST

This is by far the most difficult operation to implement, and there are 3 cases for it. Either the node we are trying to delete has:
- No child
- One child
- Two children

We can account for all these cases but first we must have a function to count how many children a node has:

class Node:
	$\Phi$
	def children_count(self):
		if node is None:
			return None
		count = 0
		if self.left:
			count += 1
		if self.right:
			count += 1
		return count

### Complete code:

class Node:
	$\Phi$
	def delete(self, data):
		if node is not None:
			children_count = node.children_count()
			if children_count = 0:
				if parent.left is node:
					parent.left = None
				else:
					parent.right = None
				del node
			elif children_count = 1:
				if node.left:
					n = node.left
				else:
					n = node.right
				if parent:
					if parent.left is node:
						parent.left = n
					else:
						parent.right = n
				del node
			else:
				parent = node
				successor = node.right
				while successor.left:
					parent = successor
					successor = successor.left
				node.data = successor.data
				if parent.left = successor:
					parent.left = successor.right
				else:
					parent.right = successor.right

### Traversing a BST

class Node:
	$\Phi$
	def print_tree(self):
		if self.left:
			self.left.print_tree()
		print self.data,
		if self.right:
			self.right.print_tree()

---

## 4. Complexity

Now let's discuss the time complexity of each of these operations.

- Searching
- Insertion
- Deletion

are all $O(\log n)$ in the average case but can degrade to $O(n)$, but this can be avoided by using things like AVL or Red-Black balanced trees.

---

## 5. Example of Deletion

This is an example that applies everything we've learnt in this section of ADS so far.

Suppose we have the following binary tree:

![[Pasted image 20250509195435.png]]

And wish to delete the node with value 23, to do this we would have replace it's data with the successor (the smallest value in the right subtree) and then delete the successor from the tree.
