## 1. Balanced BST

It's good for us if the a binary search tree is balanced because then the time complexity of operations is $O(\log n)$. but if the BST is degenerated then it can be $\Omega(n)$. So what if we try and make it so that when we perform these insertions or deletions that the tree being operated on doesn't degenerate, well there are many methods for this but we are only going to see AVL trees and red-black trees. 

### Rotations

This is a basic re-balancing operation that preserves BST property, there are left and right rotations with the following assumptions:

- left-rotation on $x$: right child not NULL (used when the right subtree is heavier)
- right-rotation on $y$: left child not NULL (used when the left subtree is heavier)

This operation is local, meaning it modifies a constant number of parent-child links. Hence each simple rotation takes $O(1)$ time.

You can also perform a compound operation upon 3 nodes that is called a Trinode restructuring, this looks like this:

This operation can be undergone through 4 cases:
- Left - Left (Single Rotation)
- Right - Right (Single Rotation)
- Left - Right (Double Rotation)
- Right - Left (Double Rotation)
A diagram representing these 4 cases is shown below:

## 2. AVL Trees

An AVL tree is a self-balancing BST with the following additional property:

- For each node $v$, the heights of $v$'s children differ by at most $1$.

In an AVL, when we perform an operation we must maintain balance, and to do this we can use the rotations as mentioned before, and depending on the type of imbalance we will use 1 of the 4 cases of trinode restructurings to regain balance (to the force). 

This is an example of a BST, the question is, is it an AVL?

Yes, this tree is an AVL because there is at most a difference of 1 between the heights of the children of any node, for example:

- If we label the tree as follows to display the height of each node in the tree:

We can see that the maximum difference of any 2 childrens nodes is at most 1. To add onto this it's a fact that:
- The height of an AVL tree storing $n$ keys is $O(\log n)$.

When we insert into an AVL, we must ensure that we're keeping balance by doing as follows:

1. Insert the element into the AVL as we normally would with any BST
2. Iteratively move upwards from the inserted node to the root to find an imbalanced node
3. If an imbalanced node is found perform the appropriate rotations to rebalance it

Now, there's a few key things I'd like to mention before we proceed any further. First of all, a node is defined to be unbalanced if it's $|balance \space factor| > 1$, and the balance factor is the difference between the height of the left subtree of a node and the right subtree. And a node is balanced if the balance factor $\leq 1$.

This is each of the cases that can happen when inserting data and how we should respond to them:


| Case        | Condition                          | Rotation(s)                     | Steps                                                             |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Left-Left   | BF > 1 (Insert in left of left)    | Right Rotation                  | Promote $y$, make $a$ its right child $T_{2}$ as $a$'s left child |
| Right-Right | BF < -1 (Insert in right of right) | Left Rotation                   | Promote $y$, make $α$ its left child, $T2$ as $α$’s right child   |
| Left-Right  | BF > 1 (Insert in right of left)   | Left Rotation -> Right Rotation | Left rotate $y$, then right rotate $α$, promote $x$               |
| Right-Left  | BF < -1 (Insert in left of right)  | Right Rotation -> Left Rotation | Right rotate $y$, then left rotate $α$, promote $x$               |

Each of these rotations will take $O(1)$ time because there is a constant amount of links.
