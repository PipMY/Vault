## 1. Arrays

A sequence of elements $a_1, a_2,...,a_n$ is called an array and usually denoted by something like $A[0], A[1],...,A[n]$ or $A[1...n]$. All elements of an array must be of the same type, this means all integers or all strings or all true/false values, this is a property known as homogeneity and this data structure is said to be homogeneous. 

There is another property of arrays known as contiguity, this means that the elements are in consecutive memory cells. These 2 properties make it easy to do certain operations but difficult to do others.

This is an example of how the $string$ "Party" could be stored, as an array of characters:

| Index   | 0      | 1      | 2      | 3      | 4      | 5      | 6      |
| ------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Value   | P      | a      | r      | t      | y      | NULL   |        |
| Address | 0x3412 | 0x3413 | 0x3414 | 0x3415 | 0x3416 | 0x3417 | 0x3418 |
The size of an array is fixed when we declare it (so it cannot change).

## 2. Linked Lists

For linked lists there are a few main principles:

- A list is made up of $nodes$, each node stores an element (a piece of data) and a pointer to another node.
- The first node is called the head.
- The last node is called the tail and points to null.
- The nodes may be scattered all over memory (so they are not contiguous).

For a list $L$ assume we have pointers (and possibly the size of the list $L.size$):
- $L.head$
- $L.tail$

You refer to a node $N$ using:
- $N.data$ (To get the element)
- $N.next$ (The pointer to the next node in the list (could be NULL))

When we want to alter the list, let's say we want to delete the head or insert a new item into the linked list we must repair all connections either side of the node we effect.

## 3. Doubly Linked Lists

This is another type of a linked list, its when a node stores 2 references:
- A next pointer, which points to the next node in the list.
- A prev pointer, which points to the previous node in the list.

In order to simplify this we add 2 sentinel (dummy) nodes at the ends of the doubly linked list:
- The header has a valid next reference but a null prev reference.
- The trailer has a valid prev reference but a null next reference.

A doubly linked list needs to store 2 references (head and tail) and also a size counter of the list (this counter does not include the sentinels).  

An empty list would have 2 sentinel nodes pointing to each other.

## 4. Circularly Linked List

A circularly linked list has the same kind of nodes as a singly linked list. That is, each node has:

- A reference to an element
- A next pointer

The difference between this and a normal linked list is that there is no beginning or end. The last node points back to the first node, so instead of references to the head and the tail, we mark a node as the cursor. The cursor is the starting node when we traverse the list.
