## 1. What is a graph?

A mathematical model that represents relations between pairs of objects, however, this is a more formal definition: A graph $G$ is a pair $(V(G), E(G))$, where $V(G)$ is a nonempty set of vertices and $E(G)$ is a set of unordered pairs $\{u,v\}$ with $u,v\in V(G)$ and $u \ne v$, called the edges of $G$.

Note: If it's not confusing we can also write $uv$ instead of $\{u,v\}$.
