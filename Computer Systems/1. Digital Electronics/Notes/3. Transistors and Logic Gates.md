## 1. Introduction and Historical Context

Digital systems have evolved significantly over time:

- Babbage's Analytical Engine used mechanical gears
- Early electrical computers relied on relays or vacuum tubes
- Modern computers use transistors as their fundamental building blocks

## 2. Transistors: The Foundation of Modern Computing

### 2.1 What is a Transistor?

Transistors are electrically controlled switches that turn ON or OFF when voltage or current is applied to a control terminal. They are the essential components that enable digital computation.

### 2.2 MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor)

- The most common type of transistor in modern computing
- Remarkable scalability: up to 57 billion MOSFETs can be integrated onto a single silicon chip
- Modern computing power stems from this incredible density of switching elements

### 2.3 Transistor Types

- **n-MOS**: Turns ON when a high voltage is applied to the gate
- **p-MOS**: Turns ON when a low voltage is applied to the gate

### 2.4 Transistor Structure

- Three terminals: Gate (G), Source (S), and Drain (D)
- The connection between Drain and Source is controlled by the voltage at the Gate
- Example mentioned: ZXMN3F30FH (a specific transistor model)

## 3. From Transistors to Digital Circuits

Digital circuits are built from small electronic components called logic gates:

- Each logic gate performs a specific Boolean logic function
- Logic gates are constructed from one or more transistors
- The output of one logic gate can feed into other gates, creating complex circuits

## 4. Binary Addition: A Practical Example

Binary addition follows 8 simple rules:

1. 0 + 0 = 0
2. 0 + 1 = 1
3. 1 + 0 = 1
4. 1 + 1 = 0 with Carry
5. Carry + 0 + 0 = 1
6. Carry + 0 + 1 = 0 with Carry
7. Carry + 1 + 0 = 0 with Carry
8. Carry + 1 + 1 = 1 with Carry

Example of binary addition:

```
  11100
+ 01110
-------
 101010
```

## 5. Boolean Algebra: The Mathematics Behind Digital Logic

Boolean algebra operates with just two values:

- 1/0, True/False, or high/low voltage
- Forms the mathematical foundation for all digital systems

The basic operations are:

- AND
- OR
- NOT

## 6. Logic Gates and Truth Tables

## 7. Transistor Implementations of Logic Gates

### 7.1 NOT Gate Implementation

- Uses one p-MOS (P1) and one n-MOS (N1) transistor
- When input A is high:
    - p-MOS P1 is OFF
    - n-MOS N1 is ON
    - Output Y is connected to GND (low)
- When input A is low:
    - p-MOS P1 is ON
    - n-MOS N1 is OFF
    - Output Y is connected to VDD (high)

|A|P1|N1|Y|
|---|---|---|---|
|0|ON|OFF|1|
|1|OFF|ON|0|

### 7.2 NAND Gate Implementation

- Uses two p-MOS (P1, P2) and two n-MOS (N1, N2) transistors
- Note on circuit diagrams: 3-wire junctions are connected, but 4-wire junctions are only connected if there is a dot

|A|B|P1|P2|N1|N2|Y|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|0|0|ON|ON|OFF|OFF|1|
|0|1|ON|OFF|OFF|ON|1|
|1|0|OFF|ON|ON|OFF|1|
|1|1|OFF|OFF|ON|ON|0|

### 7.3 AND Gate Implementation

- Essentially combining a NAND gate with a NOT gate

## 8. Digital Abstraction and Logic Levels

### 8.1 Digital Abstraction

- In reality, chips don't work with exact 0s and 1s
- Voltages are real numbers between 0V and VDD (typically 5V historically)
- We map these continuous values to discrete 0s and 1s
- Need to account for noise in the system

### 8.2 Supply Voltage

- Low voltage (connected to ground or GND) is 0V
- High voltage (VDD) was historically 5V
- Modern chips with smaller transistors use lower voltages:
    - 3.3V, 2.5V, 1.8V, 1.5V, and 1.2V
- Lower voltages save power and prevent overloading transistors

### 8.3 Logic Levels

Define the mapping between continuous voltage and discrete digital values:

- **VOH to VDD**: Permitted range for high output
- **GND to VOL**: Permitted range for low output
- **VIH to VDD**: Acceptable range for high input
- **GND to VIL**: Acceptable range for low input

### 8.4 Noise Margins

- High noise margin: $NM_{H} = V_{OH} - V_{IH}$
- Low noise margin: NML = VIL - VOL
- Larger noise margins mean greater tolerance to electrical noise

## 9. The Static Discipline

- A fundamental principle guaranteeing that "if inputs meet valid input thresholds, then the system guarantees outputs will meet valid output thresholds"
- Prevents outputs from falling into the "forbidden zone" between valid logic levels
- Gates are grouped into logic families that obey the static discipline when used together

### 9.1 Logic Families and Their Characteristics

|Logic Family|VDD|VIL|VIH|VOL|VOH|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|TTL|5 (4.75-5.25)|0.8|2.0|0.4|2.4|
|CMOS|5 (4.5-6)|1.35|3.15|0.33|3.84|
|LVTTL|3.3 (3-3.6)|0.8|2.0|0.4|2.4|
|LVCMOS|3.3 (3-3.6)|0.9|1.8|0.36|2.7|

## 10. Moore's Law

- Formulated by Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel in 1968
- Originally observed in 1965 that the number of transistors on a computer chip doubles every year
- Commonly quoted as "transistor density doubles every 2 years" or "computing power doubles every 18 months"
- Has held remarkably true for decades
- Recent growth has been particularly strong in graphics processing capabilities
- Illustrates the exponential growth in computing power over time

### 10.1 Impact of Moore's Law

As quoted in the lecture: "If the automobile had followed the same development cycle as the computer, a Rolls-Royce would today cost $100, get one million miles to the gallon, and explode once a year..." - Robert Cringely

This quote illustrates the extraordinary pace of advancement in computing compared to other technologies.
