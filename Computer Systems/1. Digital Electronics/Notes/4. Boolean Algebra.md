## 1. Functionally Complete Sets of Logic Operations

### 1.1 Basic Logic Operations

The fundamental logic operations previously covered include:

- AND gate: Output is 1 only when all inputs are 1
- OR gate: Output is 1 when at least one input is 1
- NOT gate: Inverts the input
- NAND gate: Inverse of AND gate (outputs 0 only when all inputs are 1)

### 1.2 Exclusive OR (XOR) Operation

The XOR gate outputs 1 when inputs are different:

|A|B|Y|
|---|---|---|
|0|0|0|
|0|1|1|
|1|0|1|
|1|1|0|

XOR can be constructed using AND, OR, and NOT gates:

- Y = (A · B̄) + (Ā · B)

### 1.3 Functionally Complete Sets

A functionally complete set of Boolean operators is one that can express all possible truth tables through combinations of operations.

**Canonical Functionally Complete Set:**

- AND, OR, and NOT form a functionally complete set

**Universal Gates:**

- Charles Sanders Peirce (1880) proved that NOR gates alone form a functionally complete set
- Henry M. Sheffer (1913) proved that NAND gates alone form a functionally complete set

### 1.4 Implementing Basic Gates with NOR

- NOT: A̅ = A NOR A
- OR: A + B = (A NOR B) NOR (A NOR B)
- AND: A · B = (A NOR A) NOR (B NOR B)

### 1.5 Implementing Basic Gates with NAND

- NOT: A̅ = A NAND A
- AND: A · B = (A NAND B) NAND (A NAND B)
- OR: A + B = (A NAND A) NAND (B NAND B)

### 1.6 Practical Considerations

NAND gates are easier to manufacture and use less silicon for the same performance compared to NOR gates, making them common as universal gates in practical designs (e.g., the 7400 chip).

## 2. Combinational Logic and Circuits

### 2.1 Digital Design Principles

Digital design manages complexity through several key principles:

- **Abstraction**: Hiding details when they aren't important
- **Discipline**: Restricting design choices for easier modeling and combination
- **Hierarchy**: Dividing systems into modules and submodules
- **Modularity**: Defining clear functions and interfaces for modules
- **Regularity**: Encouraging uniformity for module reuse

### 2.2 Circuit Fundamentals

A circuit is a network that processes discrete-valued variables, consisting of:

- One or more discrete-valued input terminals
- One or more discrete-valued output terminals
- A specification of the relationship between inputs and outputs
- A specification of the delay between input changes and output responses

Circuits are composed of:

- **Elements**: Smaller circuits with their own inputs, outputs, and specifications
- **Nodes**: Wires joining elements, whose voltage conveys discrete-valued variables

### 2.3 Combinational Logic Rules

For a circuit to be combinational:

1. Individual gates must be combinational circuits
2. Every circuit element must be a combinational circuit
3. Every node is either an input to the circuit or connects to exactly one output of a circuit element
4. The circuit cannot have cyclic paths (every path through the circuit visits any node at most once)

## 3. Sum of Products vs. Product of Sums

### 3.1 Boolean Expression Formats

Any Boolean function can be expressed in two canonical forms:

**Sum of Products (SoP):**

- ORing minterms together
- Each minterm corresponds to an input combination where the function outputs 1
- Example: $F(X,Y,Z) = X̄·Ȳ·Z̄ + X̄·Y·Z + X·Ȳ·Z + X·Y·Z̄$

**Product of Sums (PoS):**

- ANDing maxterms together
- Each maxterm corresponds to an input combination where the function outputs 0
- Example: $F(X,Y,Z) = (X+Y+Z)(X+Ȳ+Z̄)(X̄+Y+Z̄)(X̄+Ȳ+Z)$

### 3.2 Converting Truth Tables to SoP

For a given truth table, identify all rows where the output is 1. For each such row:

1. Create a minterm where uncomplemented variables correspond to 1s and complemented variables correspond to 0s
2. OR all these minterms together

Example:

```
X Y Z F(X,Y,Z)
0 0 0    1
0 0 1    0
0 1 0    0
0 1 1    1
1 0 0    0
1 0 1    1
1 1 0    1
1 1 1    0
```

$F(X,Y,Z) = X̄·Ȳ·Z̄ + X̄·Y·Z + X·Ȳ·Z + X·Y·Z̄$

### 3.3 Converting Truth Tables to PoS

For a given truth table, identify all rows where the output is 0. For each such row:

1. Create a maxterm where complemented variables correspond to 1s and uncomplemented variables correspond to 0s
2. AND all these maxterms together

Using the same example: $F(X,Y,Z) = (X+Y+Z)(X+Ȳ+Z̄)(X̄+Y+Z̄)(X̄+Ȳ+Z)$

### 3.4 Circuit Implementation

Sum of Products forms are implemented with AND gates feeding into a single OR gate. Product of Sums forms are implemented with OR gates feeding into a single AND gate.

## 4. Boolean Algebra

### 4.1 Basic Concepts

Boolean algebra is used to:

- Specify the function of combinational circuits
- Analyze and simplify circuits to achieve the same truth table with less hardware

**Key elements:**

- Variables represented by letters (A, B, C...)
- Complement/inverse indicated by a bar (Ā)
- Variables or their complements are called literals

### 4.2 Axioms of Boolean Algebra

Axioms are fundamental assumptions that cannot be proven:

|Axiom|Dual axiom|Name|
|---|---|---|
|B = 0 if B ≠ 1|B = 1 if B ≠ 0|Binary field|
|0̄ = 1|1̄ = 0|NOT|
|0 · 0 = 0|1 + 1 = 1|AND/OR|
|1 · 1 = 1|0 + 0 = 0|AND/OR|
|0 · 1 = 1 · 0 = 0|1 + 0 = 0 + 1 = 1|AND/OR|

Each axiom has a dual obtained by interchanging AND and OR, and 0 and 1.

### 4.3 Theorems of One Variable

Theorems can be proven by applying axioms and checking cases:

|Theorem|Dual theorem|Name|
|---|---|---|
|B · 1 = B|B + 0 = B|Identity|
|B · 0 = 0|B + 1 = 1|Null element|
|B · B = B|B + B = B|Idempotency|
|B̄̄ = B|-|Involution|
|B · B̄ = 0|B + B̄ = 1|Complements|

### 4.4 Theorems of Multiple Variables

|Theorem|Dual|Name|
|---|---|---|
|BC = CB|B+C = C+B|Commutativity|
|(BC)D = B(CD)|(B+C)+D = B+(C+D)|Associativity|
|B(C+D) = BC+BD|(B+C)(B+D) = B+(CD)|Distributivity|
|B(B+C) = B|B+(BC) = B|Covering|
|BC+BC̄ = B|(B+C)(B+C̄) = B|Combining|
|BC+BD̄+CD = BC+BD̄|(B+C)(B+D̄)(C+D) = (B+C)(B+D̄)|Consensus|
|B̄₀·B̄₁·B̄₂... = B₀+B₁+B₂...|B̄₀+B̄₁+B̄₂... = B₀·B₁·B₂...|De Morgan's|

### 4.5 De Morgan's Theorem

De Morgan's Theorem is particularly important for circuit simplification and transformation:

- The complement of a product equals the sum of complements: A̅·B̅ = A + B
- The complement of a sum equals the product of complements: A̅+B̅ = A · B

This can be proven by checking all possible input combinations.

### 4.6 Circuit Simplification Approach

The key principles for simplification are:

1. Use the Combining theorem (T10) and Consensus theorem (T11) to remove variables or terms
2. Use other theorems to rearrange expressions so T10 or T11 can be applied

The general form of the Combining theorem is: for any implicant (product or sum) P and variable $A, PA+PĀ = P$

### 4.7 Simplification Example

Given the truth table:

```
A B C Y
0 0 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1
0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0
1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1
1 1 1 0
```

1. Sum of products form: $Y = \overline A·B·\overline C + \overline A·B·C + A·B·\overline C$
    
2. Simplification using Boolean algebra: $Y = \overline A·B·(\overline C+C) + A·B·\overline C \space Y = Ā·B + A·B·C̄ Y = B·(Ā + A·C̄) Y = B·(Ā + C̄)$
    

The simplified expression provides the same logical output with much less hardware.

## Summary

Boolean algebra provides the mathematical foundation for digital logic design. It allows designers to:

1. Express digital logic functions in standard forms (SoP or PoS)
2. Simplify logic expressions to create more efficient circuits
3. Transform between different logic implementations using theorems
4. Build complex digital systems using functionally complete sets of operations

The combination of Boolean algebra principles with digital design methodologies (hierarchy, modularity, and regularity) enables the creation of complex yet reliable digital systems that form the basis of modern computing technology.
