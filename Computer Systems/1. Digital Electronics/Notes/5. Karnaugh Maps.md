## 1. Introduction

**Karnaugh Maps (K-Maps)** are used to simplify Boolean expressions by grouping adjacent 1s (minterms) in a truth table.

- Provide a visual alternative to algebraic simplification.
    
- Reduce the number of logic gates in a digital circuit.
    
- Especially effective for functions with 2 to 4 variables; can be extended up to 6 variables with complexity.

## 2. Two-Variable K-Map

Layout (Gray Code Ordering):

|AB|00|01|11|10|
|---|---|---|---|---|
||m0|m1|m3|m2|

### Example:

Function: F(A, B) = Σ(0,1,3)

1. Fill in the K-Map:
    
    - m0, m1, m3 = 1
        
2. Group adjacent 1s:
    
    - m0 & m1: A̅ (B changes)
        
    - m1 & m3: B
        

**Simplified Expression:**

```
F = A̅ + B
```

## 3. Three-Variable K-Map

|AB\C|0|1|
|---|---|---|
|00|m0|m1|
|01|m2|m3|
|11|m6|m7|
|10|m4|m5|

### Example:

Function: F(A,B,C) = Σ(1,3,5,7)

1. Fill in the map:
    
    - m1, m3, m5, m7 = 1
        
2. Group:
    
    - m1 & m3: A̅B·C
        
    - m5 & m7: AB·C
        
    - Combine: C
        

**Simplified Expression:**

```
F = C
```

## 4. Four-Variable K-Map

|AB\CD|00|01|11|10|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|00|m0|m1|m3|m2|
|01|m4|m5|m7|m6|
|11|m12|m13|m15|m14|
|10|m8|m9|m11|m10|

### Example:

Function: F(A,B,C,D) = Σ(0,2,8,10)

1. Fill in the K-Map: m0, m2, m8, m10 = 1
    
2. Group:
    
    - m0 & m2: A̅B̅D̅
        
    - m8 & m10: AB̅D̅
        
    - Combine: B̅D̅
        

**Simplified Expression:**

```
F = B̅D̅
```

## 5. Grouping Rules

- Group adjacent 1s in sizes that are powers of two: 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.
    
- Make groups as large as possible to minimize the number of terms.
    
- A cell can be in multiple groups.
    
- K-Maps wrap around horizontally and vertically (toroidal adjacency).
    
- Avoid redundant groupings unless required for essential coverage.
    

---

## 6. Don’t Care Conditions

- Represented as X or d in the map.
    
- May be treated as 1s **only if** it helps in simplifying the expression.
    
- Common in digital design when certain inputs never occur (e.g., BCD > 9).
    

### Example:

F(A,B,C,D) = Σ(1,3,7) + d(0,2)

- Use d(0,2) to form a group of 4 with m1, m3 to simplify.
    

---

## 7. Prime and Essential Prime Implicants

- **Prime Implicant**: Cannot be combined further; represents a group of adjacent 1s.
    
- **Essential Prime Implicant**: Covers at least one minterm not covered by any other group; must be included in the final expression.
    
- Use a **Prime Implicant Chart** to select minimal cover.
    

---

## 8. Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages:

- Reduces complex Boolean expressions efficiently.
    
- Visual and intuitive.
    
- Reduces logic gate count.
    
- Easy to verify correctness.
    

### Limitations:

- Difficult for more than 4-5 variables.
    
- Manual process; not scalable.
    
- Errors possible in grouping if care isn’t taken.

1. **Determine the function**: Standard SOP form.
    
2. **Plot the minterms** on the K-Map.
    
3. **Group adjacent 1s** using power-of-two rules.
    
4. **Include don’t-cares** if helpful.
    
5. **Identify prime implicants**.
    
6. **Identify essential prime implicants**.
    
7. **Write the simplified Boolean expression**.
