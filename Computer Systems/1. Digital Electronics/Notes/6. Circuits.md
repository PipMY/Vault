## 1. Introduction

There are 2 key digital circuits; combinatorial and sequential. Combinatorial circuits output depends only on the current input whereas, sequential circuits output depends on state and input. Here are some examples of both types:

|              | Combinatorial | Sequential |
| ------------ | ------------- | ---------- |
| Adders       | ✅             |            |
| Decoders     | ✅             |            |
| Multiplexors | ✅             |            |
| Counters     |               | ✅          |
| Flip-flops   |               | ✅          |
| Registers    |               | ✅          |
| Clocks       |               | ✅          |

## 2. Half-Adders

A half-adder is a digital circuit that allows for the addition of 2 binary digits $A$ and $B$. It takes these as the inputs and the outputs are $Sum$ and $Carry$, $$Sum = A \space XOR \space B$$ $$Carry = A \space AND \space B$$
This means that if the binary digits 1 and 1 are added together the sum would be 0 and the carry be 1, this means we would need to loop this into another half-adder to be able to calculate the true value of this addition.

---
## 3. Full-adder

For a full-adder the input is not just $A$ and $B$, but $A, B$ and $Carry$ from the previous bit. To build this we are essentially going to use 2 half-adders, the first half-adder with take the inputs $A$ and $B$ and gives their $Sum$ to the second half-adder, this second half-adder will then take the $Sum$ of $A$ and $B$ and the $Carry$ in from the previous bit, the $Carry$ out is then calculated as the $OR$ of the $Carry$ of both half-adders.

| A   | B   | $C_{in}$ | Sum | $C_{out}$ |
| --- | --- | -------- | --- | --------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0        | 0   | 0         |
| 0   | 0   | 1        | 1   | 0         |
| 0   | 1   | 0        | 1   | 0         |
| 0   | 1   | 1        | 0   | 1         |
| 1   | 0   | 0        | 1   | 0         |
| 1   | 0   | 1        | 0   | 1         |
| 1   | 1   | 0        | 0   | 1         |
| 1   | 1   | 1        | 1   | 1         |

## 4. Ripple Carry Adder

A ripple carry adder is how we would add multi-bit registers, for example if we wanted to add 1011 (11) and 0001 (1) we would construct a 4-bit adder by chaining together full-adders and letting their $C_{out}$ lead into the next full-adder.

More full-adders can be chained together to make any $n$-bit adder.

## 5. Subtractor

As well as building an digital circuit to compute the addition of 2 binary registers, we can also build a digital circuit to compute the subtraction of 2 binary registers. This can be done by using the twos-complement form of $B$ and adding it to $A$, this is essentially adding $-B$ to $A$. We can do this by simply building an adder that has a not gate before the $B$ input of each full-adder and setting the first $C_{in} = 1$. This gives the effect of converting $B$ to $-B$.

## 6. Decoder

A decoder has $N$ inputs and $2^N$ outputs. It has exactly 1 output that depends on the binary number represented by the $N$ input bits. This output is called $one-hot$, because exactly one is hot (high) at a given time.

A $2-bit$ decoder can also be written as a $2:4$ decoder.

Truth table for 2 bit decoder with inputs $A_0,A_1$ and outputs $Y_0,Y_1,Y_2,Y_3$:

| $A_1$ | $A_0$ | $Y_3$ | $Y_2$ | $Y_1$ | $Y_0$ |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | 1     |
| 0     | 1     | 0     | 0     | 1     | 0     |
| 1     | 0     | 0     | 1     | 0     | 0     |
| 1     | 1     | 1     | 0     | 0     | 0     |
It can be seen that there is a unique 1 in each row, this means that if the inputs associated with that row are the inputs given then the $Y_n$ in the column of the row of those inputs will be called.

## 7. Mux (Multiplexor)

A mux will chose 1 of many inputs to steer its single output under the direction of control inputs (selector), this means that if the input to a circuit can come from several places a Mux is one way to funnel the multiple sources selectively to the single input.

A multiplexor has 1 output and $k+2^k$ inputs, the first $k$ inputs (the selector $S$) represent a binary number. The output takes the value of one of the remaining $2^k$ inputs, the one indexed by the selector.

For a 2-to-1 mux:

The truth table would be as follows:

| $S$ | $D_0$ | $D_1$ | $Y$ |
| --- | ----- | ----- | --- |
| 0   | 0     | 0     | 0   |
| 0   | 1     | 0     | 1   |
| 0   | 0     | 1     | 0   |
| 0   | 1     | 1     | 1   |
| 1   | 0     | 0     | 0   |
| 1   | 1     | 0     | 0   |
| 1   | 0     | 1     | 1   |
| 1   | 1     | 1     | 1   |
This is what a 4-to-1 line mux could look like:

## 8. Tristate

In contrast to a normal buffer which is either 1 or 0 as its output, a **tristate buffer** can be electrically disconnected from the bus wire, so it will have no effect on any other signals currently on the bus. To do this it takes both a binary input and an **enable signal** that essentially says whether the binary input can speak or not.

The truth table for a tristate is as follows:

| Input | Enable | Output   |
| ----- | ------ | -------- |
| 0     | 0      | Floating |
| 0     | 1      | 0        |
| 1     | 0      | Floating |
| 1     | 1      | 1        |

## 9. Inverting Tristate

This is exactly the same as a normal **tristate** however, if the enable is 1 then the binary input goes through a $NOT$ gate. (Or before running into the tristate)

the truth table for an inverting tristate is as follows:

| Input | Enable | Output   |
| ----- | ------ | -------- |
| 0     | 0      | Floating |
| 0     | 1      | 1        |
| 1     | 0      | Floating |
| 1     | 1      | 0        |
