## 1. Directives

The assembly code contains some statements called directives. Directives do not correspond to assembly instructions, but the assembler will take them into account when compiling the assembly code to machine language. The use of directives, for example for defining a constant, makes it easier to develop and maintain assembly code. In AVR assembly a directive is precented by a dot (.).

The equ directive assigns a value to a label, and the label can then be used in later expressions. A label assigned a value by the equ directive is a constant, it cannot be redefined. We define a constant named delayVal with the value 10000 by: .equ delayVal, 10000

The directives .global start and .global btnLED declare the functions start and btnLED as global. This information will be used in the linker when it puts various pieces of code from several source files together.
