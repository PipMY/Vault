## 1. Compiling, Assembling and Loading

When we write code in a high level language we need to be able to translate this into machine language and start executing it, this can be done with the following steps:

1. High-level code is ran through the compiler and translated into assembly code.
2. The assembly code is then ran through the assembler which turns it into machine language code (object file).
3. The object file is then ran through a linker which combines it with other machine language code (e.g. from already compiled and assembled libraries) to create an executable.
4. The executable is then put into memory by the loader so it can be run.

The assembler makes two passes through the assembly code and turns it into the object file.

On the first pass, the assembler assigns instruction addresses and finds all symbols, such as labels and global variable names, and makes a symbol table.

In the example below, symbols will be shown in italics:

| Memory Address | Label   | Opcode | Register 1/Label | Register 2/Label | Immediate / Register / Label |
| -------------- | ------- | ------ | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 0x00400000     | *main:* | addi   | $sp,             | $sp,             | -4                           |
| 0x00400004     |         | sw     | $ra,             | 0($sp)           |                              |
| 0x00400008     |         | addi   | $a0,             | $0,              | 2                            |
| 0x0040000C     |         | sw     | $a0,             | *f*              |                              |
| 0x00400010     |         | addi   | $a0,             | $0,              | 3                            |
| 0x00400014     |         | sw     | $sw,             | $a1              | *g*                          |
| 0x00400018     |         | jal    | *sum*            |                  |                              |
| 0x0040001C     |         | sw     | $v0,             | *y*              |                              |
| 0x00400020     |         | la     | $ra,             | 0($sp)           |                              |
| 0x00400024     |         | addi   | $sp,             | $sp,             | 4                            |
| 0x00400028     |         | jr     | $ra              |                  |                              |
| 0x0040002C     | *sum:*  | add    | $v0,             | $a0,             | $a1                          |
| 0x00400030     |         | jr     | $ra              |                  |                              |

And from this the symbol table can be constructed like so:

| Symbol | Address    |
| ------ | ---------- |
| f      | 0x10000000 |
| g      | 0x10000004 |
| y      | 0x10000008 |
| main   | 0x00400000 |
| sum    | 0x0040002C |
The second pass of the assembler generates the object file by translating the assembly into actual machine code. The linker creates the executable by combining the object file with the other machine code, and then the loader puts this into the memory and its execution can start.

## 2. Programming

### Functions

Function are pieces of code which can be accessed from the other parts of the program. Using functions makes code more modular and readable. MIPS assembly functions have inputs, called arguments, and an output called return value. 

However, we need an agreement on how to:

- Call and return from a function
- Access the input arguments and the return value

### Call and Return

Consider the following code:

|            | # The caller function "main"   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| 0x00400200 | main: jal simple               |
| 0x00400204 | ...                            |
|            |                                |
|            | # The callee function "simple" |
| 0x00401020 | simple: jr $ra                 |
Here, the function "main" calls the function "simple" using the jal instruction. "jal simple" (jump and link) jumps to the address 0x00401020 (as j would do) but also stores in register $ra the address where the program should return after "simple" has been executed (here 0x00400204).

jr $ra (jump register) jumps to the address stored in a register (here $ra). Notice, that jr is an R-type not a J-type instruction.

### Arguments and Return Value

According to MIPS conventions on the behavior of caller and callee:
- The caller places the arguments into the registers $a0 - $a3
- The return value is placed into the registers $v0 - $v1
- The saved registers $s0 - $s7 are not modified by the callee

This convention can be quite restrictive, especially if the callee is going to call another function (or even call itself recursively). Instead of directly conforming to this convention, the callee can first save all important registers in a stack and restore them before returning to the caller.

### Loops

Suppose we wanted to make a MIPS program that computes the n-th triangular number. The program should take the input n and output T(n) where: $$
T(n)=1+2+\dots+n
$$
The code fragment for this could look like this:
```
      # Initialize registers
	  li     $t0, 10          # load the value of N
	  li     $t1, 0           # initialize the counter (i)
	  li     $t2, 0           # initialize sum

	  # Main loop body
loop: addi   $t1, $t1, 1      # i = i + 1
	  add    $t2, $t2, $t1    # sum = sum + i
	  beq    $t0, $t1, exit   # if i = N, break from the loop
	  j      loop

exit: ...
	  ...
```

The main loop is implemented through an unconditional jump instruction j and a branch on equal instruction beq, which branches out of the loop when the values in the registers $t0 and $t1 become equal.
