## 1. What Am I?

MIPS is an architecture that has been implemented into many processors, let's take for example a 32-bit RISC processor:

- 32-bit words
- ~ 110 instructions in the whole instruction set
- 32 general purpose registers, which are as follows:

| Name      | Number | Use                     |
| --------- | ------ | ----------------------- |
| $0        | 0      | The constant value 0    |
| $at       | 1      | Assembler temporary     |
| $v0- $v1  | 2-3    | Function return values  |
| $a0 - $a3 | 4-7    | Function arguments      |
| $t0 - $t7 | 8-15   | Temporary variables     |
| $s0 - $s7 | 16-23  | Saved variables         |
| $k0 - $k1 | 26-27  | OS temporaries          |
| $gp       | 28     | Global pointer          |
| $sp       | 29     | Stack pointer           |
| $fp       | 30     | Frame pointer           |
| $ra       | 31     | Function return address |

### Instruction Types

In MIPS there are 3 different types of instructions:

- R-type: register operands
- I-type: immediate operand
- J-type: for jumping

## 2. R-type Instruction

The format of these instructions is like this:

| op     | rs     | rt     | rd     | shamt  | funct  |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 6 bits | 5 bits | 5 bits | 5 bits | 5 bits | 6 bits |
- op - the opcode, its always 0 for R-type instructions
- rs - source register
- rt - source register
- rd - destination register
- shamt - the shift amount for shift instructions, otherwise it is 0
- funct - the function, essentially the second part of the opcode. If the first 6 bits of the instruction are 0, the computer understands it is an R-type. The function specifies which R-type instruction it is.
### Example I

The assembly code for adding the values in registers 17 ( $s1 ) and 18 ( $s1 ) and putting the answer in register 16 is: $$
\text{add } $s0, $s1, $s2
$$
### Example II

The assembly code for subtracting the value in register 13 ( $t5 ) from the value in register 11 ( $t3 ) and putting the answer in register 8: $$
sub \ $t0, $t3, $t5
$$

## 3. I-type Instruction

The format of these instructions is like this:

| op     | rs     | rt     | imm     |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------- |
| 6 bits | 5 bits | 5 bits | 16 bits |
- op - the opcode, the instruction is completely determined by the opcode.
- rs - source register
- rt - source register
- imm - 16-bit immediate written in two's complement
- rs and imm - are used as source operands, rt is used as source in some instructions and as destination in some others.

### Example I

The assembly code for adding the number 5 to the value of register 17 ( $s1 ) and putting the answer in register 16 ( $s0 ) is: $$
addi \ $s0, $s 1, 5
$$
### Example II

The assembly code for loading the number 5 into the register 16 ( $s0 ) is: $$
li \ $s 0, 5
$$
---

## 4. J-type Instruction

The format of these instructions is like this:

| op     | addr    |
| ------ | ------- |
| 6 bits | 26 bits |
- op - the opcode, the instruction is completely determined by the opcode
- addr - 26-bit address operand

### Example I

The assembly code for jumping to address 143 is: $$
j \ 143
$$

## 5. Addresses

Although it is not described in this slide I would like to cover what the addresses actually are, you can think of the MIPS instructions being stored in something conceptually like a giant array, so for example at position 5 in the array it might hold: {addi $s0, $s1, 5}. And this giant "array" would
