## 1. Lagrange Multipliers Method

The goal is to find the stationary points of an objective function $f(x) \in C^1$ subject to the constraint $g(x)=0$. 

The method:

1. Define a new objective function called the $Lagrangian$:
$$
L(x,\lambda)=f(x)-\lambda g(x)
$$
2. Find the stationary points of $L$ with respect to both $x$ and $\lambda$, i.e. solve the system of equations $\nabla f(x)=\lambda g(x)$ and $g(x)=0$ for the unknowns $x,\lambda$.
3. Then the constrained extrema are found among the solutions to these equations. Identify their nature.

## 2. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?!

Essentially, to solve a problem involving a function and some kind of constraint (this could be that it has to lie on another function, or that it be the shortest possible distance from a point). We simply follow the steps laid out above and we are able through some manipulation to get ourselves some answers, and one of a few of these answers will be the final one we need.
