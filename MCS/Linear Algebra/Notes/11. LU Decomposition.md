## **1. Introduction to LU Decomposition**

LU decomposition is a matrix factorization technique used in numerical analysis and linear algebra to simplify solving linear systems. It expresses a square matrix $A$ as the product of a lower triangular matrix $L$ and an upper triangular matrix $U$.

### **Key Ideas:**

- LU decomposition simplifies solving systems of equations by breaking them into two triangular systems.
- It is an alternative to Gaussian elimination and can be more efficient in practice.
- Not all matrices have an LU decomposition unless certain conditions are met.

## **2. Recap: Gaussian Elimination**

Gaussian elimination is a method for solving linear systems by performing elementary row operations:

1. **Swapping two rows**
2. **Multiplying a row by a nonzero scalar**
3. **Adding a multiple of one row to another**

These operations transform a matrix into an upper triangular form, which can then be solved using **back-substitution**.

## **3. LU Decomposition: Definition**

### **Definition**

An LU decomposition (or LU factorization) of a square matrix $A$ is given by:

$$A=LU$$

where:

- $L$ is a **lower triangular** matrix (entries below the diagonal are nonzero, entries above are zero).
- $U$ is an **upper triangular** matrix (entries above the diagonal are nonzero, entries below are zero).

#### **Example**
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & 6 & 2 \\ -3 & -8 & 0 \\ 4 & 9 & 2 
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 3 \\ 4  & -3 & 7
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 3 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 3 \\ 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} = LU
$$

## **4. Application: Solving Linear Systems with LU Decomposition**

Given $Ax=b$, using LU decomposition, we:

1. Rewrite as $LUx=b$.
2. Let $Ux=y$ and solve $Ly=b$ (forward substitution).
3. Solve $Ux=y$ (back-substitution).

This approach is computationally efficient, especially when solving multiple systems with the same coefficient matrix.

---
## **5. Existence of LU Decomposition**

For LU decomposition to exist:

- **Gaussian elimination must proceed without row swaps**.
- If row exchanges are required (i.e., a zero pivot appears), standard LU decomposition **fails**.
- Solution: Use **PLU decomposition** instead.

### **Theorem**

If a square matrix $A$ can be transformed into an upper triangular matrix $U$ **without row exchanges**, then $A$ can be factored as $A=LU$

---
## **6. Finding LU Decomposition**

LU decomposition can be constructed using **elementary matrices** that track row operations in Gaussian elimination.

### **Algorithm:**

1. Use Gaussian elimination to obtain an upper triangular matrix UUU.
2. Record row operations as elementary matrices.
3. Compute LLL as the product of the **inverse** of these elementary matrices.

#### **Example:**

For
$$A = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & -4 \\ 3 & -2
\end{bmatrix}$$
LU decomposition results in:

$$L = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & 0 \\ 3 & 4
\end{bmatrix}, \space \space U=\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -2 \\ 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## **7. Permutation Matrices & PLU Decomposition**

If an LU decomposition does not exist (due to row swaps being required), we use **PLU decomposition**:
$$
A = PLU
$$
where:

- $P$ is a **permutation matrix** that reorders rows.
- $L$ is a lower triangular matrix.
- $U$ is an upper triangular matrix.

### **Permutation Matrix Definition**

A **permutation matrix** is obtained by swapping rows of an identity matrix.

#### **Example**

$$
P=\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Permuting a matrix $A$ with $P$ swaps its rows accordingly.

**Theorem:** Every square matrix has a **PLU decomposition** (proof omitted).

## **8. Advantages of LU Decomposition**

- More **efficient** than Gaussian elimination when solving multiple linear systems with the same $A$.
- Used in **scientific computing**, **machine learning**, and **numerical analysis**.
- Implemented in libraries like **NumPy** and **SciPy**.
- Faster than computing $A^{-1}$ directly.
